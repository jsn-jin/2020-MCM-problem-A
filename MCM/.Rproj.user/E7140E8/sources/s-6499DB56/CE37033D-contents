## 4. 20th Year Stochastic Model Statistics  
The demographic model shows less variation, with a much lower standard deviation than the environmental model. In the environmental model, catastrophes happen infrequently, only 4% of the time, yet the results drastically change the population of bobcats. Thus, the histogram shows a more bimodal distribution, where bobcats either survive with relatively no catastrophes (following more of a deterministic model) or they suffer great population declines due to these catastrophes.
```{r}
# demographic model statistics
dem_20 <- demographic[,20]
dem_report <- summary(dem_20)
dem_report["Std.Dev."] <- round(sd(dem_20),2)
dem_report["Range"] <- range(dem_20)
dem_report["IQR"] <- round(IQR(dem_20),2)
dem_report
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
gghistogram(dem_20, title = "Demographic Model Histogram", xlab = "Population", ylab = "Frequency", col = "blue", bins = 10)
ggboxplot(dem_20, title = "Demographic Model Boxplot", xlab = "Year 20", ylab = "Population")
```
```{r}
# enviornmental model statistics
env_20 <- environmental[,20]
env_report <- summary(env_20)
env_report["Std.Dev."] <- round(sd(env_20),2)
env_report["Range"] <- range(env_20)
env_report["IQR"] <- round(IQR(env_20),2)
env_report
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
gghistogram(env_20, title = "Environmental Model Histogram", xlab = "Population", ylab = "Frequency", col = "blue", bins = 10)
ggboxplot(dem_20, title = "Environmental Model Boxplot", xlab = "Year 20", ylab = "Population")
```

## 5. Side-to-Side Boxplots  
The demographic change in distribution over 10 years follows closely to the deterministic model. On the other hand, the environmental model is almost identical to the deterministic model because they are practically the same model but environmental has the added element of a catastrophe that occcurs only 4% of the time. Since 4% is relatively small, it does not show up on the box-whisker part, but it does appear as outliers. The outliers represent each time a catastrophe occurs that significantly changes the population of the bobcats during that given year.
```{r}
# Demographic stochasticity
boxplot(demographic[,1:10], ylab = "Population", main = "Demographic Change in Distribution")
det <- matrix(rep(deterministic[1:10], each = 50), ncol = 10)
 # red represents deterministic model
boxplot(det, medcol = "red", add = TRUE, names = rep("", times = 10))

# Environmental stochasticity
boxplot(environmental[,1:10], ylab = "Population", main = "Environmental Change in Distribution")
# red represents deterministic model
boxplot(det, medcol = "red", add = TRUE, names = rep("", times = 10)) 
```

## 6. Both Demographic and Environmental Stochastic Elements  
My simulation shows that the stochastic effect is more pronounced when combining demographic and environmental stochastic effects. The demographic effect shows variation for each simulation while the environmental effect contributes to the existence of a catastrophe dependent on the population at each year of each simulation. This combined stochasticity creates a model that is more pronounced and possibly more accurately represents the population of bobcats over time.
```{r}
set.seed(68)

both <- as.data.frame(matrix(100, nrow = 50, ncol = 20))
for(i in seq_len(50)) {
  for(j in 2:20) {
    catastrophe <- runif(1)
    if(catastrophe <= 0.04) {
      births <- (rnorm(1, 0.4, 0.1)*0.7)*both[i,j-1]
      deaths <- (1 - (rnorm(1, 0.68, 0.07)*0.7))*both[i,j-1]
      both[i,j] <- both[i,j-1] + births - deaths
    } else {
      births <- rnorm(1, 0.4, 0.1)*both[i,j-1]
      deaths <- (1 - rnorm(1, 0.68, 0.07))*both[i,j-1]
      both[i,j] <- both[i,j-1] + births - deaths
    }
  }
}
